 Apple Clone Website (React + Vite)

A fully responsive **Apple website clone** built with **React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
This project recreates Apple’s modern website design, showcasing the **iPhone 17 Series, iPhone Air, AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch SE 3, Apple Watch Ultra, iPad Air**, and a fully functional footer with all navigation links.  

The goal of this project is to practice **component-based architecture, responsive UI design, and performance optimization** while replicating a real-world website.
